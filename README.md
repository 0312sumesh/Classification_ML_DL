# Dental Image Classifier

## Project Overview

This project employs Artificial Intelligence to enhance the diagnosis of dental diseases through X-ray images. Utilizing advanced machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Kernel Nearest Neighbors (KNN), this application classifies different types of dental anomalies with improved accuracy and efficiency.

## Features

- **User Management**: Users can register and log in to access the system. Admins have the ability to activate and manage user accounts.
- **Data Handling**: Users can upload dental X-ray images which are then processed using various machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Implements SVM, ANN, and KNN to analyze and classify X-ray images into categories such as normal, caries, and other anomalies.
- **Result Visualization**: Users can view and verify the classification results directly within the application.
